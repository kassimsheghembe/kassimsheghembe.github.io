I"®<p>#Speed4ne
I have had many nicknames as I grew up due to the meaning of parts of my name <strong>Kassim</strong> in <em>Swahili</em> (mother tongue in Tanzania). The part of my name <strong>sim</strong> means telephone in Swahili, as a result i was named Ka<strong>telephone</strong> in short Ka<strong>tele</strong>.</p>

<p>Also the other part which many of people didn‚Äôt figure out is <strong>Kas</strong>. Kas in <em>Swahili</em> means <strong>Speed</strong>. And the last part sim means <strong>phone</strong> as i mentioned before. So combining the two my name would be <strong>SpeedPhone</strong> in short <strong>Speed4ne</strong> to make it sound cool.</p>

<p>Why I prefer Speed4ne for Katelephone? The fact that i‚Äôm very quick in registering events to my mind and anylize as should to give out the report i would code myself to be speedy. As for Phone well that is the means <em>sim</em> in Swahili (kidding) you can say that i‚Äôm very connected to the reality of the situations and i am an introvert by name. Live more on my mind calculating and maintaining the balance/</p>

<p>That is me, Speed4ne. The easiest way to understand me is not try to understand at all. I am very flexible and so this makes very hard for people to understand. I don‚Äôt hold what is called ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù and yet you will have to convince me very well to make it tick on my mind.</p>
