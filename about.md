Hey there, I'm *Kassim Sheghembe*, and welcome to my digital abode! I'm thrilled you stopped by. Here, you'll get to know me a bit better, both professionally and personally, in a light, fun, and hopefully interesting way.

### The Scholarship Journey
Let's start with a splash of academic achievement. I'm incredibly proud to have been awarded the prestigious Julius Nyerere full scholarship to the University of Edinburgh. Imagine competing with the best and being that one lucky student each year! ðŸŽ“

I put this golden opportunity to great use and earned my MSc in Informatics from the University of Edinburgh in September 2018. But the journey doesn't stop there.

### Class Geek and Coding Aficionado
Before my Edinburgh escapade, I graduated first in my class from St. Joseph University in Dar Es Salaam, where I studied B.E. Information System and Network Engineering. Yes, I may have been a class geek, but I wear that title proudly. ðŸ¤“

Now, if you're wondering what makes me tick, it's the world of coding! I'm not just an avid programmer; I've got a serious eye for detail. Whether it's deciphering lines of code, optimizing mobile apps, tinkering with Dev Ops, or crafting web applications, I'm all in!

### Coding for a Cause
Oh, and let me tell you about my heart-driven journey of coding for a cause. After 4.5 incredible years as an ICT Developer for a Canadian charity, Farm Radio International, I felt compelled to broaden my horizons. That's when I embarked on my Edinburgh adventure. But my mission didn't end there. Since June 2019, I've been back in Tanzania, making waves as a dedicated Software Engineer for D-Tree. Together with a brilliant team, I've been using my coding prowess to revolutionize healthcare technology and make a tangible difference in communities across Tanzania. It's a path that truly ignites my soul. ðŸŒ±

### Languages and All Things Fun
On the language front, I'm bilingual â€“ fluent in English and Swahili. I find joy in breaking language barriers and connecting with people across the globe. ðŸŒŽ

And when I'm not immersed in the tech world, you'll find me being enthusiastic, energetic, and a true team player. I thrive in dynamic environments, welcome change with open arms, and learn fast. If you've got a problem, I'm your go-to problem solver. Plus, I'm known for motivating and inspiring those around me.
