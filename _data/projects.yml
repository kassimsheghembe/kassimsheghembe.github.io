    tagline: "Web application implementing ACJ for subjective assessment"
    description: "A web application that provides an interface to the Adaptive Comparative Judgement algorithm for conducting pair comparisons and assessing subjective work quality."
    long_description: |
      Adaptive Comparative Judgment (ACJ) is a sophisticated algorithm that uses the law of comparative judgement to assess work that is subjective in nature. 
      This web application implements the ACJ algorithm to provide educators and researchers with a powerful tool for evaluating creative work, essays, 
      and other subjective materials through systematic pair comparisons.
      
      The application allows multiple judges to compare pairs of work items, and uses statistical methods to derive reliable quality rankings 
      from these comparative judgements. This approach has been proven more reliable than traditional marking schemes for subjective assessments.
