title: Mobile Application For Drug Shops
---

This is an application that I developed from ground up using OpenSRP platform. I have designed and customized
it specifically for drug shops. It has protocols for assessing danger signs of pregnant women, babies, adolescents
and new mothers who present themselves to the drug shop.
