title: Meaning of Speed4ne
---

##Speed4ne
I have had many nicknames as I grew up due to the meaning of parts of my name **Kassim** in *Swahili* (mother tongue in Tanzania). The part of my name **sim** means telephone in Swahili, as a result i was named Ka**telephone** in short Ka**tele**.

Also the other part which many of people didn't figure out is **Kas**. Kas in *Swahili* means **Speed**. And the last part sim means **phone** as i mentioned before. So combining the two my name would be **SpeedPhone** in short **Speed4ne** to make it sound cool.

Why I prefer Speed4ne for Katelephone? The fact that i'm very quick in registering events to my mind and anylize as should to give out the report i would code myself to be speedy. As for Phone well that is the means *sim* in Swahili (kidding) you can say that i'm very connected to the reality of the situations and i am an introvert by name. Live more on my mind calculating and maintaining the balance/

That is me, Speed4ne. The easiest way to understand me is not try to understand at all. I am very flexible and so this makes very hard for people to understand. I don't hold what is called "status quo" and yet you will have to convince me very well to make it tick on my mind.
