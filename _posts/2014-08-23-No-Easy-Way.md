title: No Easy Way In Life!
---

There is no easy way in life. The best was aint always the fast way, and yet the best way aint alway to act nasty. Be good and honest to others and your self and avoid the shortcuts in life.

A wise person always think first before taking actions and it always pays him. Why does it pay him though?
